# gis-admin
Scripts I created in Python 3 to help complete administrative tasks such as migrating to ArcGIS Pro from ArcMap, managing ArcGIS Online users, and general data management. 

Most scripts utilize proprietary modules such as ArcPy or ArcGIS API for Python. Other scripts use the ArcGIS Enterprise REST API.
